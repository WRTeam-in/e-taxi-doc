# How to Change Default Country Code in App

> **Note:** Country code can also be managed from the **Admin Panel**. The value in `constants.dart` is used as the **default country code** in the app (for example: `"IN"` for India).

Go to `lib/core/constants/constants.dart` (in both the customer and driver apps) and update the default country code:

```dart
String countryCode = "IN";
```

Replace `"IN"` with your required country code.
