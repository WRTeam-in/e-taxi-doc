# Flutter and Java JDK Setup Guide

For a complete guide on setting up Flutter and Java JDK, please refer to our official documentation:

## Setup JDK in your system

2. Download Java JDK 17 by clicking this link: [JAVA JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

3. Download Java JDK 17 for your version 32 bit or JDK download 64 bit.

## Setup Flutter SDK

1. Download Flutter SDK version 3.47.4 (stable channel) from the official Flutter website:
   [Flutter SDK Downloads](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

2. After downloading, extract the Flutter SDK to your desired location.

3. Add Flutter to your system PATH:
   - For Windows: Add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH variable
   - For macOS/Linux: Add export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]/bin" to your shell's rc file

4. Run the following command to verify the installation:
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

> **Note:** Both the customer and driver apps require Flutter **3.44.0 or newer** (Dart 3.12+). Older Flutter versions will fail at `flutter pub get`.
